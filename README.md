# Retribution_Campaigns
Repository of DCS Retribution Campaigns

## Purpose
This repository is serving as a place for me to store DCS Retribution campaigns as I work on them.

Each campaign is organized as a folder.  Inside each folder will have the associated campaign resources.

## Campaign Installation

To install a campaign drag the .miz and .yaml files into your campaign folder under resources in Retribution.
Any factions (.json) will need to be added to the factions folder under resources.
